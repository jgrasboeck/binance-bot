## üîß Installation Guide (Step-by-Step)

### Windows or Mac

#### 1. Download the Bot

Option 1: If using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/binance-bot.git
cd binance-bot
```

Option 2: Download ZIP

* Go to the GitHub repo
* Click "Code" ‚Üí "Download ZIP"
* Unzip and open the folder

#### 2. Install Python Dependencies

Open a terminal in the project folder and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> This will install the necessary packages like `python-binance`.

#### 3. Create Your Configuration File

In the same folder, create a file called `.env` with the following content:

```
BINANCE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
BINANCE_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
SYMBOL=BTCUSDT
TRADE_AMOUNT=0.001
```

* Replace `your_api_key_here` and `your_secret_key_here` with your Binance keys.
* `SYMBOL` is the coin you want to trade (e.g., `ETHUSDT`, `BTCUSDT`, etc.)
* `TRADE_AMOUNT` is how much of the coin you want to buy or sell per trade.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Bot

In your terminal, type:

```bash
python bot.py
```

This will:

* Connect to Binance
* Monitor prices (depending on your strategy)
* Automatically place trades

You should see messages printed as the bot works (e.g., "BUY executed", "SELL executed").

---

## üîÑ What Does the Bot Actually Do?

The strategy depends on how you or the developer configured it, but common functions include:

* Monitor price changes
* Automatically buy when prices drop
* Automatically sell when prices rise
* Print logs of each trade

*You can tweak the rules inside `bot.py` if you're comfortable with simple code edits.*

## üî¢ Backtesting Features

Before risking real money, you can **backtest** the bot's performance using historical data. This helps you understand if your strategy would have worked in the past.

### How to Use Backtesting

1. Run the backtest script:

```bash
python backtest.py
```

2. The bot will simulate your trading logic using historical data for the specified coin (e.g., `BTCUSDT`).

3. You'll see:

* Total trades made
* Winning vs losing trades
* Final profit/loss

### Configuring Backtest Parameters

Edit `backtest.py` to adjust:

* Time range (e.g., last 30 days)
* Strategy logic
* Initial balance

This feature is great for:

* Testing strategies before using real funds
* Understanding market behavior
* Reducing risk

## üìÅ Files Explained

* `bot.py` ‚Äî The main bot script
* `backtest.py` ‚Äî Simulates your strategy on historical data
* `requirements.txt` ‚Äî List of required Python packages
* `.env` ‚Äî Your personal settings (API keys, trading info)
* `README.md` ‚Äî This file you're reading!

## ü¶Ø Test Before Real Use (Optional but Recommended)

Want to avoid risking real money?

You can:

1. Use Binance **testnet** (requires some setup)
2. Modify the bot to **simulate trades** (e.g., print only, no real buying/selling)

Ask for help if you want to set up a test mode!

## üìû Need Help?

If you're stuck:

* Ask a tech-savvy friend to help with the setup
* Reach out via the GitHub "Issues" tab
* Open an issue describing your problem and error messages
